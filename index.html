        <p>Hi, I’m Matthew, a full stack web developer in sunny Orange County, California. I’m a huge geek with a love
          for creating and building. What initially got me into coding was a passion to positively influence people’s
          lives. I believe technology and app creation specifically, is a powerful way to do that. After two years of
          learning to code on my own, I attended a coding bootcamp at the University Of California, Irvine. Since then
          I’ve learned a few important life lessons. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable, code everyday, and never
          stop learning!</p>

        <p>I've created websites and apps using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node, Express, SQL, MongoDB and React.
        </p>

        <p>I have a background in sales and marketing and a degree in the theatre arts. I am open to new opportunities
          and would love to speak with you about working together on a full-time or contract basis.</p>
